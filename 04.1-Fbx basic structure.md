# FBX basic structure
This tutorial will focus on the initial parsing of the binary fbx format. I chose FBX for this because it seems to be some kind of industry standard for model files. However, after working with it for a while, I would not use it for a minecraft mod. This is because blender's exporter is a bit lacking (it doesn't export all keyframe data, and doesn't export different interpolation types to fbx for animations). Instead I would use a format that blender has better support for, like collada. You could also create your own custom model format that would only contain the data you need. This would be both easier to parse and much smaller than any of the standard model files. I would highly suggest reading over [this blender article](https://code.blender.org/2013/08/fbx-binary-file-format-specification/) on how an fbx file is laid out to get a better understanding of what we are going to be doing.

Before getting started at all, we need an FBX file to parse. I will be creating one with blender, but many programs can output fbx. In blender, I made a single cube, since that's one of the simplest things to start out with and will be easier to debug if something isn't done right. If you don't want to create your own, you can use the one I'm using, located in this repo at code/assets/example/models/cube0.fbx. A text version of this file is at code/assets/example/models/cube0_ascii.fbx, I would highly recommend opening the text version with a program like Notepad++, as it greatly helps to follow along with where everything is in the text file.

## Initial structure
There are two structures we need to deal with when parsing an FBX file. The first is the file structure itself, composed of nodes and properties, and the second is a series of connections that connect objects to objects or objects to properties in a connection web. The first 27 bytes are the header. Bytes 0-20 are a file magic (file signature), and should be "Kaydara FBX Binary  " in ascii. The next two bytes are unknown, and the next 4 bytes after that is the version number as an unsigned integer. Blender exports to version 7400, so that is the version the file will have. After the header, the rest of the file contains nodes until the footer, which we don't need to worry about. This graphic shows how the file is laid out.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50186362/93274934-64565a00-f770-11ea-8009-ede140717df3.png)
Each node contains an integer that represents the end offset of the node in the file, an integer for the number of properties it has, an integer representing the size of the properties (we don't need this since objects are allocated automatically in java), an unsigned byte for the length of the node name, the node name (length is specified by the previous byte), some amount of data representing the properties, and data representing the nested lists, which continune until this node's end offset is reached. If you want a better explanation, read the blender article I linked at the top of this tutorial.

Now that we know all the data we need for parsing nodes, we can make the FBXDocument class and the FBXNode class. I will be putting everything related to the FBX initial structure under com.drillgon.example.model.fbx.document. The FBXDocument class needs to store the header information (file magic and version), and a list of contained FBXNodes. I will also add methods for getting the list of child nodes by name for ease of access. Since we're going to be loading this from a binary file, we will take a ByteBuffer as a constructor argument and use that to gather the data we need. First, we make sure the buffer is in little endian order, since that's the order FBX files use. Then, we extract the name, the version, and parse everything else in the file as an FBXNode until we reach an unknown number that seems to signal the footer. Since we don't care about the footer, we won't parse it.
```java
public class FBXDocument {

	public String file_magic;
	public int version;
	public List<FBXNode> nodes = new ArrayList<>();
	
	public FBXDocument(ByteBuffer buf) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, DataFormatException {
    		//Make sure the byte order is little endian so we get the correct data
		buf.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN);
    		//Get the next 20 bytes, which represent the file magic, and turn it into a string
		byte[] magic = new byte[20];
		buf.get(magic);
		file_magic = new String(magic, "UTF-8");
    		//Skip the null string terminator and the two unknown bytes
		buf.position(buf.position()+3);
		version = buf.getInt();
		
		while(buf.hasRemaining()){
      			//Gets a bit of data that could be the footer number, and resets the position so in case it's not, we can read more nodes normally
			long footerCheck = buf.getLong();
			buf.position(buf.position() - 8);
      			//This magic number seems to mean we're at the footer, and we don't care about parsing that
			if(footerCheck == 7409768082772311290L)
				return;
			nodes.add(new FBXNode(buf));
		}
	}
	
	public List<FBXNode> getChildNodes(String name, boolean searchChildren){
		List<FBXNode> childNodes = new ArrayList<>();
		for(FBXNode node : nodes){
			if(name.equals(node.name)){
				childNodes.add(node);
			}
			if(searchChildren){
				childNodes.addAll(node.getChildNodes(name, true));
			}
		}
		return childNodes;
	}
	
}
```
For the FBXNode, we need an int to keep the end offset to know when to stop parsing child nodes, a string for the name of the node, an array of properties, and a list of child nodes. The first thing we parse is the end offset of the node as an integer. Then, we create the array that will store the properties with the length of the next integer. After that, we skip the integer representing the properties block size since we don't need it and parse the name. So far the class looks like this.
```java
public class FBXNode {

	protected int endOffset;
	public String name;
	public FBXProperty[] childProperties;
	public List<FBXNode> childNodes = new ArrayList<>();
	
	public FBXNode(ByteBuffer buf) throws DataFormatException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
		endOffset = buf.getInt();
		childProperties = new FBXProperty[buf.getInt()];
		buf.position(buf.position() + 4); //Skip the properties list length since this java and the objects are allocated automatically
		int nameLen = buf.get() & 0xFF;
		byte[] name = new byte[nameLen];
		buf.get(name);
		this.name = new String(name, "UTF-8");
	}
}
```
Now we need to figure out how to parse properties. There are thirteen known property types: 16 bit short, one byte boolean (true if non zero), 32 bit integer, 32 bit float, 64 bit double, 64 bit long integer, float array, double array, long array, integer array, boolean array, string, and raw binary. For these, we can make a base class that can get every single one so we don't have to do any instanceof stuff making our code messy.
```java
public abstract class FBXProperty {

	public byte getByte(){
		return 0;
	}
	
	public short getShort(){
		return 0;
	}
	
	public int getInt(){
		return 0;
	}
	
	public long getLong(){
		return 0;
	}
	
	public boolean getBoolean(){
		return false;
	}
	
	public float getFloat(){
		return 0;
	}
	
	public double getDouble(){
		return 0;
	}
	
	public float[] getFloatArray(){
		return null;
	}
	
	public double[] getDoubleArray(){
		return null;
	}
	
	public int[] getIntArray(){
		return null;
	}
	
	public long[] getLongArray(){
		return null;
	}
	
	public byte[] getByteArray(){
		return null;
	}
	
	public boolean[] getBooleanArray(){
		return null;
	}
	
	public String getString(){
		return null;
	}
  
}
```
Because array types are allowed to have zip compression to make the file smaller, we will also put a method to decompress compressed arrays in this class. It will take a bytebuffer, the compressed length of the data (in bytes), and the uncompressed length (also in bytes), and return a ByteBuffer. We can use java's Inflater class to inflate the compressed byte array.
```java
public static ByteBuffer decompress(ByteBuffer inBuffer, int compressedLen, int uncompressedLen) throws DataFormatException{
    		//The byte array where we store the compressed data for the Inflater
		byte[] data = new byte[compressedLen];
		inBuffer.get(data);
    		//Create a new inflater and give it the input data
		Inflater inf = new Inflater();
		inf.setInput(data);
    		//Create a byte array that will store the decompressed data and inflate the compressed data into it
		byte[] inflatedData = new byte[uncompressedLen];
		inf.inflate(inflatedData);
		inf.end();
		
    		//Wrap a bytebuffer around the newly inflated data, make sure it's in little endian format, and return it
		ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.wrap(inflatedData);
		buf.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN);
		return buf;
	}
```

The first six types are pretty simple and roughly the same implementation, so I'll only go over the one for short. We can name the class FBXPropertyShort. It will store a single short value and override getShort to access the value. Its constructor takes a byte buffer and reads a short from it as its value.
```java
public class FBXPropertyShort extends FBXProperty {

	private short val;
	
	public FBXPropertyShort(ByteBuffer buf) {
		val = buf.getShort();
	}
	
	@Override
	public short getShort() {
		return val;
	}
}

```
Do that for the other single primitive types. Now you should have an FBXPropertyShort, FBXPropertyBoolean, FBXPropertyInteger, FBXPropertyFloat, FBXPropertyDouble, and FBXPropertyLong. The code for these can be found in the code part of this repo, if you really need it.

The array types are a little more complex, since they support compression. For an array type, the data contains an integer representing the length of the array, an integer for the encoding type, and an integer for the compressed length. We create a new array of whatever data type this is with size of the arrayLength. If the encoding is 0, it isn't compressed, so we can just read the data type into the array until the array is full. If the encoding is 1, it uses zip compression. Now we can use the decompress method we made earlier. We pass it the bytebuffer, the compressed length (which is in bytes), and the array length times the size of the data type in bytes (it needs to be in bytes for the decompression to work correctly). Floats are 4 bytes, doubles are 8 bytes, longs are 8 bytes, integers are 4 bytes, booleans are 1 byte. We can then read numbers from the bytebuffer returned from the decompress method until the array is full. If the encoding is something other than 0 or 1, it's unknown, so I throw UnsupportedOperationException. All the array types use almost the same code, so I'll only go over one. Here's the code for FBXPropertyFloatArray.
```java
public class FBXPropertyFloatArray extends FBXProperty {

	private float[] val;
	
	public FBXPropertyFloatArray(ByteBuffer buf) throws DataFormatException {
		int arrayLen = buf.getInt();
		int encoding = buf.getInt();
		int compressedLen = buf.getInt();
		val = new float[arrayLen];
		if(encoding == 0){
      			//If the encoding is 0, uncompressed, read floats into the array until it's full
			for(int i = 0; i < arrayLen; i ++){
				val[i] = buf.getFloat();
			}
		} else if(encoding == 1){
     			/If the encoding is 1, zip compression, decompress it. We pass arrayLen*4 because a float is 4 bytes.
			ByteBuffer buf2 = decompress(buf, compressedLen, arrayLen*4);
			for(int i = 0; i < arrayLen; i ++){
				val[i] = buf2.getFloat();
			}
		} else {
     			//If we don't know the compression type, throw an exception
			throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unknown array compression: " + encoding);
		}
	}
	
	@Override
	public float[] getFloatArray() {
		return val;
	}
}
```
There are two other property types, the string property, and the raw property. The string type starts with an integer determining how long the string is in bytes. After we get that, we read that number of bytes and decode the string in UTF-8 encoding.
```java
public class FBXPropertyString extends FBXProperty {

	private String val;
	
	public FBXPropertyString(ByteBuffer buf) throws UnsupportedEncodingException {
		int length = buf.getInt();
		byte[] data = new byte[length];
		buf.get(data);
		val = new String(data, "UTF-8");
	}
	
	@Override
	public String getString() {
		return val;
	}
}

```
For the raw type, we read the number of bytes to read, then get that number of bytes into a byte array.
```java
public class FBXPropertyRaw extends FBXProperty {

	private byte[] val;
	
	public FBXPropertyRaw(ByteBuffer buf) {
		int length = buf.getInt();
		val = new byte[length];
		buf.get(val);
	}
	
	@Override
	public byte[] getByteArray() {
		return val;
	}
}

```

Now that we have all our property classes set up, we can return to our FBXNode class and parse them. Since we already know how many child properties there are, we can just parse that many.
```java
for(int i = 0; i < childProperties.length; i ++){
	childProperties[i] = parseProperty(buf);
}
```
Each property starts with the id character telling us which type it is. Refer to the blender article or my comments to see which id corresponds to what. We can just switch over the character byte and return a different property depending on what the type character is. If it's unknown, I throw an IllegalArgumentException. I got the character ids from an ascii table.
```java
public static FBXProperty parseProperty(ByteBuffer buf) throws DataFormatException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
		byte id = buf.get();
		switch(id){
		case 89: //Y, a 2 byte signed integer (short)
			return new FBXPropertyShort(buf);
		case 67: //C, a boolean value
			return new FBXPropertyBoolean(buf);
		case 73: //I, a 4 byte signed integer
			return new FBXPropertyInteger(buf);
		case 70: //F, a 4 byte floating point
			return new FBXPropertyFloat(buf);
		case 68: //D, an 8 byte floating point (double)
			return new FBXPropertyDouble(buf);
		case 76: //L, an 8 byte signed integer (long)
			return new FBXPropertyLong(buf);
		case 102: //f, a float array
			return new FBXPropertyFloatArray(buf);
		case 100: //d, a double array
			return new FBXPropertyDoubleArray(buf);
		case 108: //l, a long array
			return new FBXPropertyLongArray(buf);
		case 105: //i, an int array
			return new FBXPropertyIntegerArray(buf);
		case 98: //b, a boolean array
			return new FBXPropertyBooleanArray(buf);
		case 83: //S, a String
			return new FBXPropertyString(buf);
		case 82: //R, raw binary data
			return new FBXPropertyRaw(buf);
		default:
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad property id: " + id);
		}
	}
```
Now that we have the properties parsing set up, we can parse the sub nodes. This is really simple: while we haven't reached the end of this node, add a new node to the list.
```java
while(buf.position() < endOffset){
	childNodes.add(new FBXNode(buf));
}
```
I also added two more methods to the FBXNode class for getting a list of children by name, or a single child by name. The whole class should now look like this.
```java
public class FBXNode {

	protected int endOffset;
	public String name;
	public FBXProperty[] childProperties;
	public List<FBXNode> childNodes = new ArrayList<>();
	
	public FBXNode(ByteBuffer buf) throws DataFormatException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
		endOffset = buf.getInt();
		childProperties = new FBXProperty[buf.getInt()];
		buf.position(buf.position() + 4); //Skip the properties list length since this java and the objects are allocated automatically
		int nameLen = buf.get() & 0xFF;
		byte[] name = new byte[nameLen];
		buf.get(name);
		this.name = new String(name, "UTF-8");
		for(int i = 0; i < childProperties.length; i ++){
			childProperties[i] = parseProperty(buf);
		}
		while(buf.position() < endOffset){
			childNodes.add(new FBXNode(buf));
		}
	}
	
	public static FBXProperty parseProperty(ByteBuffer buf) throws DataFormatException, UnsupportedEncodingException {
		byte id = buf.get();
		switch(id){
		case 89: //Y, a 2 byte signed integer (short)
			return new FBXPropertyShort(buf);
		case 67: //C, a boolean value
			return new FBXPropertyBoolean(buf);
		case 73: //I, a 4 byte signed integer
			return new FBXPropertyInteger(buf);
		case 70: //F, a 4 byte floating point
			return new FBXPropertyFloat(buf);
		case 68: //D, an 8 byte floating point (double)
			return new FBXPropertyDouble(buf);
		case 76: //L, an 8 byte signed integer (long)
			return new FBXPropertyLong(buf);
		case 102: //f, a float array
			return new FBXPropertyFloatArray(buf);
		case 100: //d, a double array
			return new FBXPropertyDoubleArray(buf);
		case 108: //l, a long array
			return new FBXPropertyLongArray(buf);
		case 105: //i, an int array
			return new FBXPropertyIntegerArray(buf);
		case 98: //b, a boolean array
			return new FBXPropertyBooleanArray(buf);
		case 83: //S, a String
			return new FBXPropertyString(buf);
		case 82: //R, raw binary data
			return new FBXPropertyRaw(buf);
		default:
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad property id: " + id);
		}
	}
	
	public List<FBXNode> getChildNodes(String name, boolean searchChildren){
		List<FBXNode> childNodes = new ArrayList<>();
		for(FBXNode node : this.childNodes){
			if(name.equals(node.name)){
				childNodes.add(node);
			}
			if(searchChildren){
				childNodes.addAll(node.getChildNodes(name, true));
			}
		}
		return childNodes;
	}
	
	public FBXNode getChildNode(String name, boolean searchChildren){
		return getChildNodes(name, searchChildren).get(0);
	}

}
```

We are now done with parsing the initial FBX data structure.
## Connections data structure
For FBX model files, there is a secondary structure that links all the data needed for a model together. It is defined in the connections part of the file, and looks like this in ascii format for our simple cube model. It gets a lot more complex for more complex models, but this works fine for basic structure parsing.
```
; Object connections
;------------------------------------------------------------------

Connections:  {
	
	;Model::Cube, Model::RootNode
	C: "OO",43287744,0
	
	;Geometry::Cube.001, Model::Cube
	C: "OO",43281744,43287744
}
```
The OO means "Object to Object" connection. This can also be OP, which means "Object to Property". The two numbers refer to the id of the object child and the object parent, respectively. The OP connection has one extra value, which is the name of the property node it is referencing.

To begin parsing this secondary structure, we need to have an FBXDocument first, so let's make the start of an FBXModelLoader class. We will put new two methods in this class: load, which takes a resource location and turns it into a bytebuffer to be parsed by the next method, which is parse. These will eventually both return FBXModels, but we don't have that yet, so they will return void for now. This is the class so far.
```java
public class FBXModelLoader {

	public static void load(ResourceLocation file){
		try {
    			//Gets the input stream from minecraft's resource manager and turns it into a bytebuffer
			InputStream s = Minecraft.getMinecraft().getResourceManager().getResource(file).getInputStream();
			ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.wrap(IOUtils.toByteArray(s));
			buf.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN);
			/*return*/ parse(buf);
		} catch(Exception e) {
			new Exception("Error loading fbx model: " + file.toString(), e).printStackTrace();
		}
		//return null;
	}
	
	private static void parse(ByteBuffer buf) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, DataFormatException{
		FBXDocument doc = new FBXDocument(buf);
	}
}
```
As you might have noticed, the object connections use ids to link objects, and the FBX document organizes by name. In the objects section of the FBX file, the id of the object is always the first property. So, to make it easier to link by id, we can add all the objets to a map of ids to nodes. Since this is a new data structure, and each node has its own connection children and parents, we should make a new class called ConnectionNode that has an FBXNode and a list of ConnectionNode parents and a list of ConnectionNode children. It also has a list of property names and connection nodes for OP connections. We should also make a class called Connection to hold the data housed by each connection in an easier to understand format. It will hold a String for its name (OO or OP), longs for its left and right nodes, and another String for the optional property name used in the OP connections. These data classes should look like this. I made them subclasses of FBXModelLoader.
```java
protected static class Connection {
		String type;
		long left;
		long right;
		//Only for OP connections, OO connections don't need it
		String propertyName;
	}
	
	protected static class ConnectionNode {
		FBXNode node;
		List<ConnectionNode> children = new ArrayList<>(2);
		List<ConnectionNode> parents = new ArrayList<>(1);
    		//For OP connections
		List<Pair<String, ConnectionNode>> childPropertyNodes = new ArrayList<>(1);
	}
```
Now, we're going to add a bunch of blank ConnectionNodes to the map of ids to nodes that won't have any connections yet. To do this, we can get the first Objects node from the document, loop through every child node in it, make a new connection node with it, and add it to the map with the node's first property (which is always the id) as the key.
```java
   		 //Get a list of child nodes with the name Objects. Since there's always only one, we can just get the first.
		FBXNode objects = doc.getChildNodes("Objects", false).get(0);
		Map<Long, ConnectionNode> idObjectMap = new HashMap<>();
   		 //Make the root node. It always has the id of 0
		ConnectionNode root = new ConnectionNode();
		root.node = objects;
		idObjectMap.put(0L, root);
		for(FBXNode object : objects.childNodes){
     		 //If the name is empty, we don't want to add it. Every FBX Node has a null child node with an empty name for some reason.
			if(!object.name.isEmpty()){
       				 //Create a new ConnectionNode wrapped around the FBXNode and add it to the map with the long stored in the first property (the id).
				ConnectionNode node = new ConnectionNode();
				node.node = object;
			
				idObjectMap.put(object.childProperties[0].getLong(), node);
			}
		}
```
Now that we have the map storing all the object nodes by id, we can start linking them all together. First, we need to get an array of all the connections. I made a helper method for this to keep the main method cleaner. First, we get the Connections Node from the document, then make a new array list that will store all the connections we can extract. We then loop through all the child nodes in connections, check if the node isn't the null node, and add it to connection list as a new Connection structure. Then, we return the connections list as an array. If the connection is an OP connection, it has an extra property, so we check that and add the extra property if it is.
```java
private static Connection[] getConnections(FBXDocument doc) {
		FBXNode connections = doc.getChildNodes("Connections", false).get(0);
		List<Connection> returnConnections = new ArrayList<>(connections.childNodes.size()-1);
		for(FBXNode connection : connections.childNodes){
			if("C".equals(connection.name)){
				Connection c = new Connection();
				c.type = connection.childProperties[0].getString();
				c.left = connection.childProperties[1].getLong();
				c.right = connection.childProperties[2].getLong();
				if("OP".equals(c.type)){
					c.propertyName = connection.childProperties[3].getString();
				}
				returnConnections.add(c);
			}
		}
		return returnConnections.toArray(new Connection[0]);
	}
```
```java
Connection[] connections = getConnections(doc);
```
Now that we have all our connections, we can link all the ConnectionNodes together. I made another helper method for this, though it probably isn't necessary. It takes the conncetion array and the idObjectMap and links all the objects together. It loops through the connection array. If it's an OO connection, we grab the parent and the child, and add the child to the parent and the parent to the child. The parent is identified by the id on the left, and the child is the id on the right. If it's an OP connection, we get the parent and the child just like an OO connection, and put the child in the map by property name.
```java
private static void buildConnections(Connection[] connections, Map<Long, ConnectionNode> idObjectMap) {
		for(Connection c : connections){
			if("OO".equals(c.type)){
				ConnectionNode parent = idObjectMap.get(c.right);
				ConnectionNode child = idObjectMap.get(c.left);
				parent.children.add(child);
				child.parents.add(parent);
			} else if("OP".equals(c.type)){
				ConnectionNode parent = idObjectMap.get(c.right);
				ConnectionNode child = idObjectMap.get(c.left);
				parent.childPropertyNodes.put(c.propertyName, child);
			}
		}
	}
```
```java
buildConnections(connections, idObjectMap);
```
We are now done parsing both structures of an FBX file! The second structure's root is stored in the root ConnectionNode we made, and we will use that later when parsing models. It's extremely helpful to visualize the connection web, so here's a grapic for this file.

The geometry one is where all the data for our vertices is, and we will be parsing that to a renderable model in the next tutorial.
