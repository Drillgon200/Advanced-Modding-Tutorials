# Introduction
When I first started modding, there were tons of modding tutorials, and there still are. However, as I got better at it, I noticed a distinct lack of advanced tutorials that show you how to do stuff beyond the basic implementation of regular minecraft things. Most tutorials seem to just end after tile entities, and maybe inventories and basic machines. The idea of these tutorials is to cover more advanced topics, such as shaders, custom particle systems, and loading models and animations made in 3rd party programs like blender.

Since these are "advanced" tutorials, I'll assume you already know how to do things like set up a mod, make blocks and items, create tile entities, do basic networking, etc. I won't be covering those, as that's been done many times before, and probably with far better code than what I'm capable of producing.

## ***Disclaimer:***
I do not always write the best code, follow the best practices, or use the most readable or efficient methods for doing things. There are going to be places where I do things badly or wrong. Keep that in mind, and don't hate me too much when I fail to do something the right way. I'm always looking to improve, so just open an issue or write a comment telling me what I did wrong if you find an error.
